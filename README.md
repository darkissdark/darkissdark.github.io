## 🕒 Auto-updated Last Commit Date

-   The file `lastUpdate.js` is automatically updated before every commit and deploy (see `scripts/updateLastUpdate.cjs` and Husky pre-commit hook).
-   You can use this date in any component (e.g. HeroCard.vue) to show the last update.

---

## 🌐 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

-   Static site is generated with `yarn generate` and deployed via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
-   All images must be optimized and placed in `public/images/projects/` (webp/png/jpg).
-   **Nuxt Image/IPX is NOT used** for production – use `<img>` with ready images for full compatibility.

---

## 🎨 Styling & Formatting

-   **Tailwind CSS** for all layout and utility classes
-   **Prettier** config in `.prettierrc` (4 spaces, single quotes, trailing commas)
-   Custom utility classes (e.g. `.text-shadow`, `.size18`) in SASS or global CSS

---

## 🤝 Accessibility & Best Practices

-   High-contrast buttons and text
-   Responsive/adaptive layout
-   Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
-   Keyboard and screen reader friendly
